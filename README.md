# HEALTH APPLICATION CONCEPTION
---
This project aims to develop an application that provides support and guidance for individuals with diabetes. The project includes the following key steps:

## 1. Dataset preprocessing

The first step involves preprocessing the dataset related to diabetes. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing variables, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

## 2. Data exploration

### Univariate Analysis

As part of the health application conception project, univariate analysis will be conducted to gain insights into individual variables in the diabetes dataset. Univariate analysis focuses on examining and summarizing each variable independently. The main objectives of univariate analysis include:

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculating basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of each variable.

- Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of the variables using charts, histograms, box plots, or other graphical techniques. These visualizations can help identify patterns, outliers, and the overall distribution of the data.

- Data Quality Checks: Checking for missing values, outliers, or any data inconsistencies in each variable. This step ensures the data's integrity and helps identify any data preprocessing requirements.

- Variable Transformation: Exploring the need for variable transformations such as normalization or log transformations to address skewness or improve data distribution.

- Statistical Tests: Conducting statistical tests specific to some variables, such as hypothesis testing, to assess the significance of relationships or differences between groups.

Through univariate analysis, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of each variable's characteristics, identify potential issues in the dataset, and determine the most relevant variables for subsequent multivariate analysis. The findings from the univariate analysis will inform further steps in developing the health application, such as feature selection, data preprocessing, and model development.


### Bivariate Analysis

In the health application conception project, bivariate analysis will be conducted to examine the relationships between pairs of variables in the diabetes dataset. Bivariate analysis focuses on analyzing the association or dependency between two variables at a time. This analysis provides valuable insights into how two variables interact and influence each other.

The key objectives of bivariate analysis include:

* Correlation Analysis: Assessing the correlation between two variables to determine the strength and direction of their relationship. Correlation analysis helps identify variables that are positively or negatively correlated, indicating whether they tend to increase or decrease together.

* Hypothesis Testing: Performing statistical tests such as t-tests or chi-square tests to determine if there is a significant association or difference between two variables. This helps in identifying important variables and their impact on health outcomes.

* Visualization: Utilizing visual techniques such as scatter plots, line graphs, or box plots to visualize the relationship between two variables. Visualization aids in understanding patterns, trends, or outliers in the data.

* Stratification: Stratifying or dividing the dataset based on a specific variable to analyze the relationship between two variables within different subgroups. This helps identify potential interactions or differences in the relationship between variables across subgroups.

By conducting bivariate analysis, we can uncover the relationships between pairs of variables in the diabetes dataset. This analysis helps in identifying important predictors, understanding the impact of different variables on health outcomes, and informing the development of the health application to provide personalized recommendations and interventions for individuals with diabetes.


### Multivariate Analysis with PCA and MCA

In the health application conception project, we will perform multivariate analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). These techniques allow us to explore and analyze the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to identify the underlying structure or patterns in a high-dimensional dataset. It achieves this by transforming the original variables into a new set of orthogonal variables called principal components. The principal components are ordered in terms of their variance, with the first component explaining the largest amount of variance in the data.

By applying PCA to the diabetes dataset, we can:

- Identify the most important variables that contribute to the overall variation in the data.
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting a subset of the most informative principal components.
- Visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space to detect patterns or clusters.

### Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

MCA is a multivariate analysis technique specifically designed for categorical or qualitative variables. It enables us to explore the relationships and associations between multiple categorical variables in a dataset. MCA creates a new set of dimensions, similar to PCA, where each dimension represents a combination of the original categorical variables.

By applying MCA to the diabetes dataset, we can:

- Analyze the relationships between different categorical variables.
- Identify associations or dependencies between categories of variables.
- Visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space to identify patterns or clusters in the categorical variables.

Both PCA and MCA provide valuable insights into the structure and relationships within the diabetes dataset. These analyses help in understanding the interplay between variables, identifying key factors, and informing the development of the health application to address specific needs and provide personalized recommendations for individuals with diabetes.


## 4. Application idea justification with statistic result

Based on the analysis and findings from the previous steps, the application concept will be justified using statistical results. Statistical evidence will be presented to support the application's potential benefits for individuals with diabetes. This may include demonstrating improved blood sugar control, lifestyle management, or personalized recommendations based on the data analysis.

By following these steps, we aim to develop a comprehensive health application that can assist individuals with diabetes in managing their condition effectively. The application will provide personalized support, educational resources, and actionable insights to promote better health outcomes.
